 * Interface for economy providers.

 * that implements this interface. This provides a unified way to interact with

 *
 * All money-modifying methods use callbacks because some economy plugins
 * (like BedrockEconomy) perform database operations asynchronously.
 * For synchronous plugins (like EconomyAPI), the callback is called immediately.
